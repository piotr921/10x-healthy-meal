# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - HealthyMeal
## 1. Product Overview
The HealthyMeal MVP is a web application designed to assist users in adapting culinary recipes to their personal dietary needs. The core functionality revolves around an AI-powered engine that suggests modifications to user-provided recipes based on their saved dietary preferences. The application aims to provide a simple, efficient solution for creating personalized, health-conscious meals. The MVP will focus on core features, including user account management, recipe storage, and AI-driven modifications, with a strict 6-week development timeline and a focus on low-cost solutions.

## 2. User Problem
Many individuals find it challenging and time-consuming to adapt existing online culinary recipes to fit their specific dietary requirements, such as allergies, health-related diets (e.g., veganism), or personal ingredient restrictions. This process often requires manual research and guesswork to find suitable ingredient substitutions that do not compromise the integrity of the dish. HealthyMeal aims to solve this problem by automating the recipe modification process, providing users with tailored suggestions quickly and efficiently.
