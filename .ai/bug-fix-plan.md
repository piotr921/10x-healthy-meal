Assume that you are an experienced front-end developer, and you have fix the bug in the 10x-healthy-meal app.

<current-behaviour>
1. I'm logged in as a default user.
</current-behaviour>


<expected-behaviour>
1. I'm logged in as a default user.
</expected-behaviour>

First, review the following information:

<types>
 #types.ts 
</types>  

<implementation_rules>
#copilot-instructions.md
#ui-shadcn-helper-instructions.md
</implementation_rules>

Check the implementation:
<service>
#dietary-preferences.service.ts
</service>


Check general plans for UI (#ui-plan.md) and API (#api-plan.md) and compare them against detailed plans for the problematic view (#dietary-preferences-view-implementation-plan.md). Try to find and inconsistencies that caused described issue.


Before creating the final bug fix plan, conduct analysis and planning inside <implementation_breakdown> tags in your thinking block. This section can be quite long, as it's important to be thorough.


<implementation_approach>
Implement a maximum of 3 steps from the implementation plan, briefly summarize what you've done, and describe the plan for the next 3 actions - stop work at this point and wait for my feedback.
</implementation_approach>


During the fix:
- Add any necessary components and front-end code
- Implement input validation for all parameters
- Implement error handling for each stage of the process
- Ensure proper data processing and transformation according to requirements
- Prepare the response data structure
- Update plans that did not contain possibility of adding dietary preferences through dietary preferences view.

After completing the implementation, ensure it includes all necessary imports, function definitions, and any additional helper functions or classes required for the implementation.

If you need to make any assumptions or have any questions about the implementation plan, present them before writing code.

Remember to follow REST API design best practices, adhere to programming language style guidelines, and ensure the code is clean, readable, and well-organized. Do not delete existing endpoint implementations, add new code alongside them.
