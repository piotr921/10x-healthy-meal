# Application – HealthyMeal (MVP)

### Main Problem

Adapting online culinary recipes to personal needs and dietary requirements is problematic. The application uses AI and user preferences to suggest tailored recipes.

### Minimum Viable Functionality

* Saving, reading, browsing, and deleting recipes in text form
* A simple user account system to associate each user with their own recipes
* A user profile page for saving dietary preferences
* AI integration allowing recipe modification based on the user’s dietary preferences

### Out of Scope for MVP

* Importing recipes from a URL
* Rich multimedia support (e.g., recipe photos)
* Sharing recipes with other users
* Social features

### Success Criteria

* 90% of users have completed the dietary preferences section in their profile
* 75% of users generate one or more recipes per week
