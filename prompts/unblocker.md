You are an experienced {{DevOps Engineer}} - with your help I would like to understand a new topic.

My knowledge level: {{advanced}} in {{JavaScript}} technology.

I have {{6 years}} of experience with {{React, Redux and Jenkins}}.

Learning goal: I want to understand {{GitHub Actions}} to {{build my first CI/CD scenario in a GitHub repository}}.

I encounter the following blocker: {{How a job differs from a workflow and on which system the tasks should be run - Ubuntu or Windows?}}.

Please explain this topic step by step, starting from {{basics}} and moving to {{advanced aspects/practical application}}.

I learn best through {{problem visualizations and practical diagrams}}.

I prefer an answer in the form of {{brief instruction with examples/extensive explanation with comments/demonstration project/series of exercises with increasing difficulty}}.

Can you help me understand this topic and unblock my learning?
