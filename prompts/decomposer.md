You are an experienced Full-Stack Software Engineer tasked with breaking down a complex problem into manageable steps. The problem you need to address is:

<problem>{{Problem}}</problem>

Your solution should be aligned with the following tech stack:

<tech_stack>{{TechStack}}</tech_stack>

Your goal is to provide 3-5 practical steps that will help me to collaborate effectively with large language models (LLMs) like Claude 3.5 Sonnet on this task. These steps should be tailored to the specific characteristics of LLMs, including their potential limitations in context retention and knowledge boundaries.

Before presenting your final list of steps, in <problem_analysis> tags, analyze the problem and consider how to best adapt the steps for LLM collaboration. Include the following:

1. Summarize the key aspects of the problem
2. Identify potential challenges for LLM collaboration
3. List any specific technical considerations related to the engineering role
4. Consider how each step can be formulated to work within the context limitations of LLMs
5. Determine if any aspects of the problem might require breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces for an LLM
6. Reflect on how to ensure that the steps account for potential gaps in an LLM's knowledge or understanding

After your analysis, present a numbered list of 3-5 practical steps. Each step should be concise yet informative, providing clear guidance on what needs to be done. The steps should cover the process from initial setup to final adjustments, if applicable.

Remember to focus on making these steps practical and actionable, specifically designed for collaboration with LLMs on the given task within the context of full-stack web application development.
