# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
The codebase centers on the TypeScript exercises in `banking/`, where `banking.ts` implements domain logic, `banking.test.ts` holds Vitest coverage, and `types.ts` defines shared interfaces. The accompanying `banking-spec.md` records functional requirements. Prompt experiments live in `prompts/`, split into English and Polish variants, while `charts/request.md` documents Mermaid diagram tasks. Static assets reside under `docs/`, and root-level configs (`tsconfig.json`, `package.json`) drive tooling.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
Run `npm install` before contributing. Use `npm test` to execute the Vitest suite; it auto-picks up `*.test.ts` files such as `banking/banking.test.ts`. When developing new flows, keep a test watcher running via `npx vitest --watch` to catch regressions early.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
Author TypeScript 5.8+ code with strict typings and no `any`, aligning with `CONVENTIONS.md`. Prefer `const` and pure functions where possible. Follow the existing two-space indentation, trailing commas, and double-quoted imports visible in `banking/*.ts`. Create new modules using PascalCase type names (`WithdrawalRequest`) and camelCase functions (`processWithdrawal`). Keep files focused: domain logic in `banking/`, supporting data or prompts in their respective folders.

## Testing Guidelines
Vitest is the single source of truth. Mirror the `describe`/`it` nesting from `banking/banking.test.ts`, and name new specs `<feature>.test.ts` beside the code they verify. Cover both happy paths and error codes (e.g., `INVALID_AMOUNT`, `ACCOUNT_NOT_FOUND`). When adding behaviours, extend the spec in `banking-spec.md` and ensure corresponding tests assert messages and codes explicitly.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
Follow the Conventional Commits pattern seen in history (e.g., `feat: add overdraft guard`, `chore: update prompts`). Scope commits tightly and include failing-test reproductions when fixing bugs. Pull requests should link to any tracked task, summarize behavioural changes, and attach CLI output (`npm test`) or screenshots for documentation updates. Request review from another agent when altering shared abstractions or prompts to maintain consistency.
